												<span class="left image square mini" title="Me playing a piece for a friend's birthday party"><img src="images/music1.jpg" alt ="Me playing a piece for a friend's birthday party" /></span>
												<p>As the firstborn son, my parents didn't actually consider sending me to music classes. The idea of learning the piano (the first ever musical instrument I know of) came when my parents were inquiring music lessons for my sister in a music school. They thought that a girl would be more suitable to learn the elegant instrument, but as a curious eight year old I immediately pestered them to go for these lessons. As far as I could remember, I was mainly curious about the instrument, than being interested in learning it.</p>
												<span class="image right square mini" title="Piano Concerto in G by Ravel, performed by Helene Grimaud, at the Hill Auditorium, Ann Arbor"><img src="images/music2.jpg" alt="Piano Concerto in G by Ravel, performed by Helene Grimaud, at the Hill Auditorium, Ann Arbor"/></span>
												<p>That incident has since changed and affected me to be the person I am today. I took piano lessons for more than 10 years, which I grew to love the instrument, and classical music as well. In that period, I went from being stubbornly reluctant to passionately eager to practice and learn the instrument. Thanks to my parents' and teacher's unwavering commitment in ensuring that I do my daily bit of practice, I have managed to become a slightly-better-than-average piano player who has the ability to tackle challenging pieces without the talent to master them. Despite that, I still love classical music a lot (and to play them myself especially), discovering glimpses of its magnificence every once in a while. My second favourite music genre would be jazz, and blues would be right after that.</p>
												<span class="image left square mini" title="Draft of 'First Fall' - my first composition project"><img src="images/music3.jpg" alt="Draft of 'First Fall' - my first composition project" /></span>
												<p>I still have the habit of practicing the piano, which to me is more of a hobby and a stress reliever than a chore. I also like attending classical music concerts, operas and plays, which are of an abundance in the United States. I was a LSA Music Minor at the University of Michigan, which I had the pleasure of learning from brilliant professors and instructors, many of which are rather well known. I took mainly composition and musicology courses, since the idea of performing daunted me, which I enjoyed immensely.</p>

												<h4 class="initial h4">Projects</h4>
												<li>
													<a href="files/Canon in Threes Ter-Lemas.pdf">Canon in Threes Ter-Lemas</a>
													<p>This work was written for the Malaysia Midwest Games Closing Ceremony - Midwest Night's opening performance. Using the theme of Johann Pachabel's Canon in D, I made a medley with some waltzy motives that combined the crowd-favourite tune with a Malay '90s hit pop song for the flute, alto saxophone, piano, two violins, and a drum. Due to my lack of knowledge in composing for the drum, the drum parts were instructed verbally instead with much involvement of the player's creativity.</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<a href="files/Dark Chocolate Dance.pdf">Dark Chocolate Dance</a>
													<p>This was my end-of-semester project in my first composition course, where we had to have our compositions performed, either by ourselves or by other musicians. I wrote this piece primarily to dedicate it to a person that I admired then, who is a great dancer. The harp and tenor saxophone was chosen as my two other voices in this project because I could only find a harpist and a saxist to perform with me.</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<a href="files/Melody for Piano and Violin.pdf">Melody for Piano and Violin</a>
													<p>This was my very first proper attempt in composition. Composed as my mid-semester project, I wrote this simple piece with much effort in attempting counterpoint melodies, which was the main goal of the project. I didn't have a title for it, but called it 'First Fall' when asked to by my professor, only because it was my very first fall semester at the University of Michigan.</p>

												<h2 class="individual">Sports & Outdoor Activities</h2>
											</header>
											<section class="interests section">
												<p>As mentioned in my background section under my profile, I grew up with minimal exposure to electronic entertainment, due to my father's doctrine of the goodness of the outdoors. And so, I busied myself with sports or whatever kinds of outdoor activities I could find as my hobby.</p>
												<span class="image right square mini" title="At the 'Big House', the 3rd largest stadium in the world (also my university's stadium) catching Manchester United vs Real Madrid"><img src="images/sports1.jpg" alt="At the 'Big House', the 3rd largest stadium in the world (also my university's stadium) catching Manchester United vs Real Madrid"/></span>
												<p>My favourite sport is soccer which I still do play once in a while. Soccer was one of the earliest sports I tried, and exposure to matches on the TV intensified my passion for the sport. But being an organized team sport, I resort to playing tennis often when it was hard to find soccer buddies. I also enjoy swimming a lot, which gives me a sense of empowerment.</p>
												<span class="image left square mini" title="Perhentian Island, on the east coast of Penisular Malaysia"><img src="images/sports2.jpg" alt="Perhentian Island, on the east coast of Penisular Malaysia"/></span>
												<p>Being an outdoor person, I love sceneries of isolated tranquil, which I get to enjoy often when I go hiking or travelling. I appreciate the greatness of the natural world immensely, and am a big fan of beaches and national parks.</p>
