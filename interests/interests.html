												<p>
													As the firstborn son, my parents didn't actually consider sending me to music classes.
													The idea of learning the piano (the first ever musical instrument I know of) came when my parents were inquiring music lessons for my sister in a music school.
													They thought that a girl would be more suitable to learn the elegant instrument, but as a curious eight year old I immediately pestered them to go for these lessons.
													As far as I could remember, I was mainly curious about the instrument, than being interested in learning it.
												</p>
												<span class="image right square mini" title="Piano Concerto in G by Ravel, performed by Helene Grimaud, at the Hill Auditorium, Ann Arbor"><img src="images/music2.jpg" alt="Piano Concerto in G by Ravel, performed by Helene Grimaud, at the Hill Auditorium, Ann Arbor"/></span>
												<p>
													That incident has since changed and affected me to be the person I am today.
													I took piano lessons for more than 10 years, which I grew to love the instrument, and classical music as well.
													In that period, I went from being stubbornly reluctant to passionately eager to practice and learn the instrument.
													Thanks to my parents' and teacher's unwavering commitment in ensuring that I do my daily bit of practice, I have managed to become a slightly-better-than-average piano player who has the ability to tackle challenging pieces without the talent to master them.
													Despite that, I still love classical music a lot (and to play them myself especially), discovering glimpses of its magnificence every once in a while.
													My second favourite music genre would be jazz, and blues would be right after that.
												</p>
												<span class="image left square mini" title="Draft of 'First Fall' - my first composition project"><img src="images/music3.jpg" alt="Draft of 'First Fall' - my first composition project" /></span>
												<p>
													Nowadays, I still have the habit of practicing the piano, which to me is more of a hobby and a stress reliever than a chore.
													I also like attending classical music concerts, operas and plays, which are of an abundance in the United States.
													I was a LSA Music Minor at the University of Michigan, which I had the pleasure of learning from brilliant professors and instructors, many of which are rather well known.
													I took mainly composition and musicology courses, since the idea of performing daunted me, which I enjoyed immensely.

													<p>
														This work was written for the Malaysia Midwest Games Closing Ceremony - Midwest Night's opening performance.
														Using the theme of Johann Pachabel's Canon in D, I made a medley with some waltzy motives that combined the crowd-favourite tune with a Malay '90s hit pop song for the flute, alto saxophone, piano, two violins, and a drum.
														Due to my lack of knowledge in composing for the drum, the drum parts were instructed verbally instead with much involvement of the player's creativity.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li><a href="files/Dark Chocolate Dance.pdf">Dark Chocolate Dance</a>
													<p>
														This was my end-of-semester project in my first composition course, where we had to have our compositions performed, either by ourselves or by other musicians.
														I wrote this piece primarily to dedicate it to a person that I admired then, who is a great dancer.
														The harp and tenor saxophone was chosen as my two other voices in this project because I could only find a harpist and a saxist to perform with me.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li><a href="files/Melody for Piano and Violin.pdf">Melody for Piano and Violin</a>
													<p>
														This was my very first proper attempt in composition.
														Composed as my mid-semester project, I wrote this simple piece with much effort in attempting counterpoint melodies, which was the main goal of the project.
														I didn't have a title for it, but called it 'First Fall' when asked to by my professor, only because it was my very first fall semester at the University of Michigan.

											<section class="non-academic section">
												<p>
													As mentioned in my background section under my profile, I grew up with minimal exposure to electronic entertainment, due to my father's doctrine of the goodness of the outdoors.
													And so, I busied myself with sports or whatever kinds of outdoor activities I could find as my hobby.
												</p>
												<span class="image right square mini" title="At the 'Big House', the 3rd largest stadium in the world (also my university's stadium) catching Manchester United vs Real Madrid"><img src="images/sports1.jpg" alt="At the 'Big House', the 3rd largest stadium in the world (also my university's stadium) catching Manchester United vs Real Madrid"/></span>
												<p>
													My favourite sport is football, a.k.a. soccer by my American friends, which I still do play almost once every week today.
													Football was one of the earliest sports I tried, and exposure to football matches on the TV intensified my passion for the sport.
													But being an organized team sport, I resort to playing tennis often when it was hard to find football buddies.
													I also enjoy swimming a lot, which gives me a sense of empowerment.
												</p>
												<span class="image left square mini" title="Perhentian Island, on the east coast of Penisular Malaysia"><img src="images/sports2.jpg" alt="Perhentian Island, on the east coast of Penisular Malaysia"/></span>
												<p>
													Being an outdoor person, I love sceneries of isolated tranquil, which I get to enjoy often when I go hiking or travelling.
													I appreciate the greatness of the natural world immensely, and am a big fan of beaches and national parks.
