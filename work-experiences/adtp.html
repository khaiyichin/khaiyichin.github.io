									<p>I became part of the American Degree Transfer Program (ADTP) Student Committee
										from January 2012 to March 2013, first as a regular Logisitcs team member, then
										as Head of the Human Resources Department. As a student body that commits to
										provide help and assistance as well as to protect the welfare of ADTP students,
										we organized events that helped students to familiarize with American cultures,
										news, and occasions.</p>

									<!-- Background -->
									<h3 class="individual">Background</h3>
									<p>The American Degree Transfer Program in Sunway University is a program designed
										to prepare students to transfer to a university in the United States, and
										sometimes the UK and Australia. For aspiring Malaysian students, it is one of
										the few affordable and reliable methods to pursue a tertiary education abroad.
										By providing elementary and pre-requisite courses, students usually fulfill the
										transfer requirements to their desired universities in the States through the
										program.</p>
									<p>The ADTP Student Committee is a student body serves the student of the program by
										ensuring their welfare, as well as to provide helpful and essential information
										about the program or events. Committee members are selected through an
										application to 1 or 2 specific departments (Communications, Logistics, Human
										Resources, Publicity), of which they will have to pass an interview by the
										lecturers and existing commitee. Once selected, the students work together in
										their applied positions under the Head of Department.</p>

									<p>I first started out as a regular member in the Logistics Department, which is
										responsible for room reservations, equipment arrangements and setups, as well as
										food or travel logistics if required. For the first few months working as a
										Logistics member, I familiarized myself and worked with various Sunway
										University departments to coordinate the tasks of setting up event locations.
									</p>
									<p>Afterwards, I was promoted to Head of Human Resources, which handles mostly
										inter-department communications as well as providing support to other
										departments, especially the Logistics Department. I was also given the
										responsibility of organizing ADTP's sports event, which became the Human
										Resources Department's main project then. We organized the ADTP Futsal Event in
										2012, and it turned out to be a great success.</p>
									<p>Working as the Head of Human Resources was one of my earliest experience in
										holding a leadership position. I learnt to distribute the tasks among the team
										members, making use of their strengths and abilities to ensure that the goal
										could be reached efficiently. Besides, I also worked closely with other
										department heads whenever an event happened in order to make sure the event ran
										smoothly, like taking over certain areas of their tasks temporarily when they
										were understaffed.</p>
