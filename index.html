                        <h3><a>Hometown</a></h3>
                        <p> I was born in 1993 in a beautiful country called
                          Malaysia, in the city of Kuala Lumpur. Growing up in
                          an immensely diverse country, I lived and learned with
                          friends and colleagues of varied races through primary
                          school till college. </p>
                        <p> As a kid, I spoke 3 languages: Malay, Mandarin, and
                          English, which was not uncommon among Malaysians. We
                          were required to learn our national language and
                          English was the main language used in teaching Science
                          and Math classes. I learnt to speak Mandarin from my
                          parents and mostly at my national Chinese primary
                          school - SJK(C) Khe Beng, while I continued learning
                          the language through my secondary education at SMK
                          Kota Kemuning, a national secondary school. </p>

                          siblings and I were exposed to the world of knowledge
                          from a tender age. Our family members enjoy a close
                          relationship with each other, and preserve Chinese
                          family traditions as proud Malaysians. </p>

                        <h3><a>Interests</a></h3>
                        <p> I grew up without a great deal of electronic
                          entertainment; I spent most of my time playing the
                          piano, reading, or playing outdoors. Those activities
                          cultivated my interests today; I'm a huge fan of
                          classical music and sports, especially football
                          (soccer). </p>
                        <p> Even when I had the time to watch the TV, I watched
                          Discovery Channel or the National Geographic Channel
                          mostly, which developed my passion for scientific
                          progress and advancement. Currently as a Mechanical
                          Engineering major, I'm interested in control and
                          mechatronic systems, as well as mechanical design. </p>

                        <h3><a>Major</a></h3>
                        <p> I transferred to the University of Michigan - Ann
                          Arbor from Sunway University in Malaysia during Fall
                          2013 as a Mechanical Engineering major. </p>
                        <p> I chose Mechanical Engineering because I love the
                          versatility of Mechanical Engineers in different
                          fields of work, and I especially love performing
                          hands-on tasks, which I enjoyed a great deal doing as
                          a Mechanical Engineering student. Besides, I was also
                          influenced by my father as a Mechanical Engineer
                          himself. His work experience as a Mechanical Design
                          Engineer appealed to me and his problem solving skills
                          impressed me as well. </p>
                        <p> I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in
                          Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) and a Minor in
                          Music in Spring 2016, and am attending graduate school
                          at the University of Texas at Austin. </p>

                        <h3><a>Courses</a></h3>
                        <p> At the University of Michigan, I've taken a lot of
                          interesting and exciting courses taught by leading
                          faculty members, especially the design courses offered
                          by the Mechanical Engineering department. For my
                          junior design project, me and my team members had to
                          design and create a linkage fully controlled by a
                          programmed microcontroller to deflect laser beams.
                          This course was one of the many that I took which
                          intensified my interest for controls and mechatronic
                          systems as I aim to familiarize myself with that field
                          of work. </p>
                        <p> I have also been fascinated by the music courses
                          that I've taken in fulfilling my Music minor
                          requirements; they provided a unique and intriguing
                          lens to music understanding and deepened my love for
                          classical music. </p>

                          Michigan Solar Car team and I worked on a project to
                          fit the car with a parking brake system to comply with
                          the 2014 American Solar Challenge regulations.

                        <p> As a person who is fascinated by scientific and
                          technological development, I enrolled as a prospective
                          Engineering student and spent 2 years in the program
                          before transferring to the University of Michigan. I
                          love building stuff and I wanted to be someone who
                          could build machines and structures with his knowledge
                          to help the society. </p>

                        <h3><a>Courses</a></h3>
                        <p> At Sunway University, I took mostly fundamental
                          courses that were essential to transfer to
                          universities in the United States. Other than the
                          required Math courses, the program also provided
                          elementary Engineering courses, which were Statics,
                          Dynamics, and Thermodynamics. I had my first taste of
                          an Engineering course in Statics, which I learned
                          about structures and rigid bodies that were in
                          equilibrium. It was also through these three
                          Engineering courses that I found out different fields
                          in which a Mechanical Engineer could work in. </p>
                        <p> I also fulfilled my humanities requirement at Sunway
                          University. One of the most memorable courses that I
                          took was THEA 1000: Introduction to Theatre. For that
                          entire semester, the students in the class assumed
                          roles in a production company, and had a mass
                          production by the end of the semester, in which I
                          acted. </p>

                        <h3><a>Activities</a></h3>
                        <p> During my time at Sunway University, I was involved
                          with extracurricular activities regularly. I was
                          involved with the ADTP Student Committee for almost a
                          year and a half, as a Head of Human Resources and a
                          Logistics team member. The projects involved were
                          mainly event organizing, such as annual dinners,
                          sporting events, freshmen welcome parties and so on. </p>
                        <p> I was also the main organizer in organizing an
                          orphanage class trip, in which we donated all of our
                          profits obtained from booths we opened at a university
                          event. We went to the orphanage and helped them clean
                          up the orphanage house as well as bought them food and
                          daily supplies. </p>
