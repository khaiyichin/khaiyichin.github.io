										<h3><a>Hometown</a></h3>
										<p>I was born in the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing
											up in an immensely diverse country, I lived and learned with friends and
											colleagues of varied ethnicities through primary school till college.</p>
										<p>As a kid, I learned to speak 3 languages: Malay, Mandarin, and English, which
											was not uncommon among Malaysians. We were required to learn our national
											language (Malay) and English was the medium used to teach Science and Math
											classes. I learned to speak Mandarin from my parents and mostly at my
											public Chinese primary school - SJK (C) Khe Beng, while I continued
											learning the language through my secondary education at SMK Kota Kemuning, a
											public secondary school.

										<h3><a>Interests</a></h3>
										<p>I grew up without a great deal of electronic entertainment; I spent most of
											my time playing the piano, reading, or playing outdoors. Those activities
											cultivated my interests today; I'm a huge fan of classical music and sports,
											especially football (soccer).</p>
										<p>As for TV programs, I only had access to documentary channels like the
											Discovery Channel and the National Geographic, which cultivated my interest
											in science and engineering from an early age.</p>

										<h3><a>Major</a></h3>
										<p>I started my graduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin in Fall
											2016, enrolled in a PhD program under the Mechanical Engineering department.
											My decision to further my studies beyond a bachelor's degree was motivated
											by the demand of engineers with advanced degrees in the robotics industry,
											an industry I was very much interested in building a career in.
										</p>
										<p>Having experienced the research scene as an undergraduate, I wanted to pursue
											a career in research and development, hence my interest in getting a PhD
											instead of just a master's. However, with my limited access to funding in
											robotics research, discontent of my lack of work experience, as well the
											ending of my research funding (of a computational materials project), I
											decided to graduate with a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering in
											Spring 2018.</p>

										<h3><a>Courses</a></h3>
										<p>I encountered quantum mechanics for the first time when I took a course on
											mathematical modeling. It was one of the most intriguing subjects that I've
											encountered, and piqued my interest so much that I did my master's thesis in
											computational models of doped carbon nanotubes.</p>
										<p>The course I valued the most in my master's degree is the one that I
											studied about optimal controllers. I've always had a great deal of interest
											in control systems theory, so learning how to design linear quadratic
											regulators and observers was very exciting.</p>
										<p>I also had the opportunity to explore the field of machine learning.
											Motivated by a famous machine learning course on Coursera, I worked on a
											semester-long project to build an Ant Colony Optimization
											algorithm to study its deterministic properties.</p>

										<h3><a>Activities</a></h3>
										<p>In my second year, I worked as a Graduate Resarch Assistant under Dr. Eric
											Fahrenthold, investigating doping effects on the conductance of carbon
											nanotubes. Using resources provided by <a
												href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/">TACC</a> I built computational
											models of carbon nanotubes to simulate and study its electronic properties.
										</p>
										<p>I was also fortunate to make some great friends through playing soccer, and
											have
											participated in UT's intramural soccer in all the semesters I was here,
											winning three outdoor soccer and one futsal championship with my team <a

										<h3><a>Major</a></h3>
										<p>I transferred to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor from Sunway
											University in Malaysia during Fall 2013 as a Mechanical Engineering major.
										</p>
										<p>I chose Mechanical Engineering because I love the versatility of mechanical
											engineers in different fields of work, and I especially love performing
											hands-on tasks. Besides, my dad's experience and problem solving abilities
											as a mechanical engineer influenced my decision to pursue my studies in that
											field.</p>
										<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Mechanical
											Engineering) and a Minor in Music in Spring 2016.</p>

										<h3><a>Courses</a></h3>
										<p>At the University of Michigan, I took many interesting and exciting courses
											taught by instructive faculty members. The design courses offered by the
											Mechanical Engineering department were especially educational and fun. For
											my junior design project, my team designed a robotic linkage to deflect
											laser beams. This course was one of many that I took that intensified my
											interest for controls and robotic systems as I aimed to familiarize myself
											with that field of work.</p>
										<p>I have also been fascinated by the music courses that I've taken in
											fulfilling my Music minor requirements; they provided a unique and an
											intriguing lens to music understanding and deepened my love for classical
											music.</p>

										<h3><a>Activities</a></h3>
										<p>In my first year, I joined the University of Michigan Solar Car team and
											designed a parking brake system for the car, which ultimately went on to win
											the 2014 American Solar Challenge. Afterwards, I was part of the <a
												href="http://ram-lab.engin.umich.edu/">Robotics and Motion Laboratory
												(RAMlab)</a> for almost 2 years, working with a PhD student <a
												href="http://www.wyattfelt.com/">Wyatt Felt</a> in
											developing a novel sensor that allowed feedback controllable soft robotic
											actuators.</p>
										<p>Besides activities that were related to my major, I was also involved with
											the University of Michigan Malaysian Student Association (MiMSA), from
											participating in plays and performances to hosting regional sporting events.

										<h3><a>Major</a></h3>
										<p>I started my American Degree Transfer Program (ADTP) in the 2011 Fall term.
											The program was designed to prepare students to transfer to American
											universities by providing courses to fulfill course requirements.</p>
										<p>Driven by my fascination in scientific and technological development, I
											enrolled as a prospective Engineering student and spent 2 years in the
											program before transferring to the University of Michigan. I love building
											stuff and I wanted to be someone who could build machines and structures
											to for our society.</p>

										<h3><a>Courses</a></h3>
										<p>At Sunway University, I took fundamental courses that were mandatory for
											transfers to universities in the United States. Other than the required
											mathematics courses, the program also provided elementary engineering
											courses, which were Statics, Dynamics, and Thermodynamics; my first of the
											batch was Statics, in which I learned about structures and rigid bodies that
											were in equilibrium. It was also through these Engineering courses that I
											discovered the different fields in which a mechanical engineer could work
											in.</p>
										<p>I also fulfilled my humanities requirement at Sunway University. One of the
											most memorable courses that I took was THEA 1000: Introduction to Theatre.
											For the entire semester, the students in the class assumed roles in a
											production company, and had a mass production by the end of the semester: my
											role in the 'company' was an actor, a role I enjoyed immensely.</p>

										<h3><a>Activities</a></h3>
										<p>During my time at Sunway University, I was involved with extracurricular
											activities regularly. For 1.5 years, I was part of the ADTP Student
											Committee as a Head of Human Resources and a Logistics team member. The
											projects involved were mainly event organizing, such as annual dinners,
											sporting events, freshmen welcome parties and so on.</p>
										<p> I was also the main organizer in arranging an orphanage class trip, in which
											we donated all of our profits obtained from booths we opened at a university
											event. We went to the orphanage and helped clean up the orphanage house as
											well as bought them food and daily supplies.</p>
